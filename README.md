# Get Started With Angular: An Opinionated Guide
This is the project to support the book [Get Started With Angular](http://amzn.to/2zMcFxD)

**Why this book?**

Many books give you everything you could possibly need to know about Angular. A lot of facts. A lot of how. Very little “Why?” Few opinions. They take forever to wade through and in the end, you still have several decisions to make.

Instead, this book is a training manual. Wherever possible, you are told not just how, but why. It is a book that comes as a result of actually training programmers new to Angular. It answers the questions that come up as a result of using Angular.

**This book is for you if want to learn about:**

- Node, NPM and the Angular CLI.
- Components, Module, Services and how they relate to each other.
- How to include CSS and JavaScript in your application the right way.
- Reactive Forms vs Templated Forms.
- RxJS, Observables, and Functional Reactive Programming.
- NgRX state management, Actions, Reducers and Effects.
- Smart components vs Dumb components.
- Routes, passing parameters, and Lazy Loading.
- Angular the way most organizations use it.
- Battle tested design patterns, architecture and coding standards.

**This book is not for you if:**
- You are looking for a book on AngularJS (AKA version 1.x).
- You want to know everything there is to know about Angular.
- You have no intention of doing the exercises.
- You have no prior experience programming.
